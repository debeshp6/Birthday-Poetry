        <p class="poem">
            if we meet in another lifetime,<br>
            i'd still choose you.<br>
            i'd recognize you in a heartbeat,<br>
            because my soul would know it's you.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            no matter how different you look<br>
            i'd fall in love with you all over again.<br>
            i just wish you would do the same for me<br>
            because in this lifetime, we drifted apart,<br>
            and i hate that we did.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            i still think, there was so much more for us,<br>
            the memories we could have made.<br>
            but you needed love, you weren't ready for<br>
            and that's what hurts me the most.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            yet through all of this, i learned one thing<br>
            that it will be okay,<br>
            not perfect, painful for sure, but okay.<br>
            i see your picture at daytime, and smile like an idiot<br>
            again i see your picture at midnight, but this time<br>
            i miss you, i cry like a baby.<br>
            they call it 'madness', but i define it as 'love'.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            and now i have to remember you for<br>
            longer than i known you.<br>
            i hope my absence gave you the peace,<br>
            my love couldn't...
